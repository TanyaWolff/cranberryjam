<h1>Invitation 2014</h1>
It's a long drive and life is busy, but we need to play.
This year will be a tribute to our dear friend and mother, <a href="http://reidfuneralhome.sharingmemories.ca/siteContent/memorial.html?personId=244058">Sandra Layng</a>, for giving us this magical place and the love of the woods, river and forest creatures.
May her memory sing with us and bring good cheer. 
We are planting trees in her honor during the first week of May. If you found a green thumb and heard the Cranberry Call, we'd love your help!
	
<h2>Invitation 2010</h2>

<p/>
To thy fine self please make a note (or rather two or three)<br>
To gather at a place remote with finest company<br>
Sweet music on a breeze afloat, we'll join in harmony<br>
<br>
The trees shall sing a whispering tune<br>
To the new moon in the afternnoon<br>
<br>
Move thy heart at joyful gait (insert happy jig)<br>
To mystic sounds that emanate (a good groove we dig)<br>
and cranberry jam will meet its fate (something small and big)<br>
<br>
a musical mine... a time so fine<br>
we'll wine and dine such food divine<br>
<br>
Bring ye spoons, strings and drums (dads kids dishes)<br>
Voices, whistles, humming hums (moms friends wishes)<br>
Doggies, tents, diddle-dee-dums (turtles loons and fishes)<br>
<br>
Joviality to anticipate, I doth not exaggerate<br>
Good folks, don't debate... July 10, please book the date!<br>
