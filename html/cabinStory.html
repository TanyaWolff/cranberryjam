Jammin Cabin </h1> <t><a href="pics/cabinStory/index.htm"></a>
<p>
Those were the days... going to university, raising a baby, building a cabin... ah to be young again (ok maybe not).
But now we be jammin' by the lake in the summers, watching the baby loons grow and making their own families. How came this to be?
<p>
I watched my dad build stuff since I was as young as I can remember: climbing the ladder to the roof to help him with shingling when I was 2, camping out by the Picanoc while Mom and Dad built a cabin when I was 5, living in a ski chalet on a mountain in Ramore while they built a house on the base when I was 10. Then at 14 I built 50 picnic tables for my parents' campground. So by the time I was 22 and had the help of a 3 year old son, Nicholas, my pride and joy, it was time to build my own cabin.
<p>
I drew a picture, picked a spot in the woods, bought some patio stones, blocks, cement and a pile of 2x6s, and started leveling the ground on August 1, 1992. Dad came home from work and saw the pile and said, I see you're really building a cabin! thus graciously accepting the daunting task of Cabin Building Supervisor. I mixed the cement while he poured it in the blocks on the patio stones. Ok, now why would you build a cabin on patio stones? My ideas of saving the world began with a strong philosophy of being good to Mother Earth, leave no footprint, do not disturb her, dig no holes, thus the patio stones. I think now though, 16 years later, we may need some wee holes cause she's tilting and people say I can't put up straight shelves! My pride, my world, the one as big as the other!
<p>
Then came the floor weekend. For that task only we rented a generator. That was the only time we had electricity on site for the power tools. The rest of the time we used a hand saw, or carried wood to the barn to use the outlet there for the skillsaw. It was arduous work and I didn't often go too far astray by the time Dad came down after work to check on my progress. The floor was the first real muscle builder since my supervisor required 2 1/2" nails in 3/4" plywood every 8 inches on every floor joist! The walls were a team effort, requiring 4 people to lift each one into place. For the roof, I cut a bevel on both ends of each rafter (at the barn) as well as a notch in each rafter where it sits on the top plate of the walls (by hand). We had a double 2x6 top plate on the walls and a 24 foot ridge beam where the top of the rafters meet, and 1/2" chipboard roof. 
<p>
The end of August was coming, school was coming, and the rains were coming... Gotta get the roof on before it rains… talk about deadlines!  But after so many long days of cabin building (I was passionate in the midst of this project, I couldn’t stop unless it got dark) I needed a breather. Thus I put my trust in the Universe to take care of my worries, and went off for the weekend. When I came back, Uncle Mike was almost done the roof shingling! He was the Chief Sky and Wind Watcher, his knowledge coming from building a cabin on the West coast, so I was very appreciative that I didn't have to shingle into the rain. I did get my share of shingling on the dormers though, spent more time cutting and tarring and patching (darn flashing!) than actually nailing in those shingles! A pre-implementation discussion with Supervisor on the dormer plan (my drawing was on 4:1" graph paper, quite intricate really but didn't very well reflect the angles posed by the dormer window frames) went something like this: You don't want dormers... Yes I do... No you don't... Yes I do... and that was that.
<p>
Next spring the ants came marching in and Doug & I had to redo all the insulation in the loft (oh right, was I supposed to put vents?) Summer '93 I spent under the cabin putting insulation in the floors in a 16" space on one end, 48" the other end. That must be where I got my great stuffy-attic-climbing-breathing-insulation-network-wiring love!!! Anyone want me to climb up in your attic? I stapled vapour barrier to the floor, yes around each floor joist too, then held up the insulation by stapling chicken wire -- try hammering on plywood upside down in such a small space -- please, really, feel free :) Note to self: insulate first before putting floorboard down. 
<p>
Sept 93 to Aug 94 I was working at Northern Telecom in Toronto. So '95 finally saw the siding... no I sawed the siding... nice beveled cedar siding cut by hand. It was slow going and I remember getting mad when the sun went down cause I couldn't saw anymore. The rewards of the day were the smiling faces of friends coming to visit who had tools shoved into their hands... I can't thank you enough! And Sudantha who not only became a siding expert, was our resident Storyteller keeping the crew entertained and spent a great deal of time listening to Nick's jokes and teaching us to take bigger steps to make time go slower.
<p>
The shell thus squared away, it was time to do some finishing touch ups inside... drywall, paint, oak trim, hardwood floors, ceramic tiles, chimney, straight shelves... these took about 5 more years. Furniture found its way in early on, donated from friends, but the first piece was... you have to guess... you'll get it... think!!  I was looking in the classifieds for a cheap woodstove and found a beautiful mahogany upright grand piano! So before even a bed came a piano... Andre said I got my priorities right! It's not there now... Dad helped move it (again) to my new house a year & a half ago. It's not moving. But if anyone has a piano they want to bring for the Cranberry Jam, that would be splendid.
<p>
And to the many people who I haven't mentioned in my story who took pride in helping me build the cabin of my dreams a heartwarming thank you... and an open invitation to come visit!
