<h1>History of Cranberry Jam</h1>
I met Kathy Adeney (fellow flautist) in Group Theory at Queen's in 1990. 
We graduated and moved to Ottawa about the same time. She said I'd have to get back into fluting when all this crazy thesis writing is behind us, and the best place was at the weekly Dunrobin jam at Tom and Lynn Duxbury's house. 
Here I fell in love with the beat happy, lap slappin,  kitchen dancin, bottines souriantes, reely fast, airy soothing, jiggling jigs and loopy hornpipin' Celtic music! I could just play all day. <p><p>
Then Pete Chan invited me to join in the Lyon Street Celtic band where our fiddle happy manager <a href="http://www.siegelproductions.ca/">Lois Seigel</a> booked us everywhere, even Cranberry Park in summer of 2000. 
That was a real gig where Rich McCarthy entertained both band and audience with his amazing song introductions and we played for the campers in Sunny Meadows, then we went back to the woods and jammed some more, and ate and swam and slept sometime I think, but had eggs n bacon made for us by the friendly campers over in the Store for breakfast. Well it was blast and we decided to jam again the next year! <p>Thus the start of a fine tradition.
